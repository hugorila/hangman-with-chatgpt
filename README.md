## How to Play

To play Hangman with ChatGPT, simply run the `hangman.py` file in your terminal:

At the start of each game, a word will be selected at random from a list of possible words. The player's goal is to guess the word by suggesting letters one at a time.

The player can make up to 6 incorrect guesses before the game ends and the player loses. If the player correctly guesses all the letters in the word before making 6 incorrect guesses, they win the game.
